Steps to run the code - 3D analysis:
 
1- Create a new folder in your drive "C:\" and change its name to "Code"
 
2- Copy all provided files in "C:\Code"
 
3- Install MATLAB software
 
4- Open MATLAB software and change the current directory to "C:\Code"
 
5- Prepare 3D X-ray images of one rock sample as mat file format 

   which is supported in Matlab  and copy the file in "C:\Code"

6- Open "Run3D.m" and enter the name of mat file 

7- Run "Run3D.m" file in MATLAB
 
8- This code outputs another mat file 

   where 1st and 2nd column include distance between two points and mu value.
